  I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the [Losos Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/losos/) at Washington University in St. Louis.  I am fascinated by the vast diversity of plants, animals, and organisms that share this planet with us.  How did they all get here? Why do they live certain places and behave in certain ways? And how do they respond and adapt to changing environments? As an evolutionary ecologist I get to investigate this history of how life evolved to create all the beautiful, diverse (and sometimes weird) organisms we see today, and how life is currently evolving to our changing world. Learn more about my past and current research interests in [projects](/project) and [publications](/publications). 
  
  I'm also on the Executive Board of the [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences Women in STEM](https://sites.wustl.edu/womeninstem/) and am the acting [Community Engagement Chair](https://sites.wustl.edu/womeninstem/committee/community-engagement/). Learn more about the [outreach events](https://sites.wustl.edu/womeninstem/category/community-engagement-events/) I've organized.
  
  When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me at the gym with friends, out birding, or curled up at home watching movies.
