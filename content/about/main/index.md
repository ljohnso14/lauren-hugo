  Iâ€™m a scientist, illustrator, and educator who explores and studies the world and how it works. I get to investigate how life evolved to create all the beautiful, diverse (and sometimes weird) organisms we see today and how these organisms are evolving in response to sprawling urbanization and climate weirding.

  I'm currently a second year Ph.D. student in the [Losos Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/losos/) at Washington University in St. Louis. My dissertation research focuses on how plants and animals adapt to changing environments. You can learn more about my past and current research interests in [projects](/project) and [publications](/publications). 
  
  I'm also on the Executive Board of the [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences Women in STEM](https://sites.wustl.edu/womeninstem/) and am the acting [Community Engagement Chair](https://sites.wustl.edu/womeninstem/committee/community-engagement/). Learn more about the [outreach events](https://sites.wustl.edu/womeninstem/category/community-engagement-events/) I've organized.
  
  When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me at the gym with friends, out birding, or curled up at home watching movies.
