 Hello! Welcome!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
  
  I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the Evolution, Ecology & Population Biology Program at Washington University in St. Louis.  I am fascinated by the vast diversity of plants, animals, and organisms that share this planet with us.  How did they all get here? Why do certain animals live certain places and behave certain ways? As an evolutionary biologist I get to investigate this history of how life evolved to create all the beautiful, diverse (and sometimes weird) organisms we see today.
