I'm and ecologist and evolutionary biologist.

I get to explore the world and study how it works.

I'm particularly interested in the role animals play in their environment. How they behave, evolve, and diversify into the many species we observe today.

I've been fortunate to research with diverse collaborators at institutions around the U.S. and World. And I'm excited to share that research with you!
