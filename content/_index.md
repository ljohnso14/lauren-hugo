description: I am a scientist who gets to explore the world and study how it works. I am particularly interested in how animals interact with their environment. How they behave, evolve, and diversify into the many species we observe today. I have been fortunate to research with diverse collaborators at institutions across the US and around the globe. I am excited to share my research with you!
