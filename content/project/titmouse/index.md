title: Behavioral Ecology of the Black-Crested Titmouse

##### During a series of field studies in 2018, we determined that adult male territory owners were more likely to attack an intruder with a longer crest (which we assumed represented a greater threat) when juvenile titmice were present during the encounter. To address the higher-than-expected unrelatedness between juveniles and their territory owner, I led our team in establishing 20 feeders and 100 nest boxes at a new field site to begin a study addressing relatedness among social groups and how relatedness of social groups affects territorial defense.
