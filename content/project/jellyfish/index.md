excerpt: Using a laboratory experiment, we determined that moon jellyfish polyps (Aurelia aurita) can cope with damaging ultraviolet B radiation by itself. However, they cannot cope with the combined intensity of ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A radiation. We also determined that moon jellyfish polyps do not have either chemical (mycosporine-like amino acids or carotenoids) or behavioral (migration) mechanisms to cope with ultraviolet radiation. Thus, the settlement of planula stage jellyfish may be critical for the success of the benthic polyp stage.
