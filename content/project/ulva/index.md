excerpt: Can algae tell us what's going on in the water? Using a field study, we discovered that both carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of the macroalga Ulva lactuca can be used to identify eutrophic environments. And using a laboratory experiment, we determined that carbon diffusion limitation can partially explain why carbon stable isotopes of Ulva lactuca shift in eutrophic environments.
